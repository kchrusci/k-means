The ovarian ligament (also called the utero-ovarian ligament or proper ovarian ligament) is a fibrous ligament that connects the ovary to the lateral surface of the uterus.
This ligament should not be confused with the suspensory ligament of the ovary, which extends from the ovary in the other direction.



The ovarian ligament is composed of muscular and fibrous tissue; it extends from the uterine extremity of the ovary to the lateral aspect of the uterus, just below the point where the uterine tube and uterus meet.
The ligament runs in the broad ligament of the uterus, which is a fold of peritoneum rather than a fibrous ligament. Specifically, it is located in the parametrium.



Embryologically, each ovary (which forms from the gonadal ridge) is connected to a band of mesoderm, the gubernaculum. This strip of mesoderm remains in connection with the ovary throughout its development, and eventually spans this distance by attachment within the labiam majus. During the latter parts of urogenital development, the gubernaculum forms a long fibrous band of connective tissue stretching from the ovary to the uterus, and then continuing into the labium majus. This connective tissue span, the remnant of the gubernaculum is separated into two parts anatomically in the adult; the length between the ovary and the uterus termed the ovarian ligament, and the longer stretch between the uterus and the labium majus, the round ligament of uterus.
