San Fernando (Saint-Ferdinand in English) is a town in the province of C diz, Spain. It is home to more than 97,500 inhabitants. The city also uses the name "La Isla" (The Island), however, the city is no longer an island, but a peninsula, as it has been connected to the mainland. The people from San Fernando are locally known as "Ca a llas" or "Isle os".



In history, the city played a paramount role when in 1810 during the French occupation led by Napoleon, San Fernando and C diz were the only parts of Spain which did not surrender to the French.
The Cortes Generales met in the Comedy Theatre (nowadays known as the Real Teatro de las Cortes) and started the preparation for the first liberal constitution of Spain, which was approved in the neighbouring city of C diz in 1812.
Flamenco singer Camar n de la Isla was born in San Fernando.
It holds the Pante n de Marinos Ilustres.
