902 TV was a television station in Greece that was supported by the KKE, the Communist Party of Greece.
It featured general entertainment programming and was available throughout Greece. On September 10, 2012, 902 TV ceased operations due to financial difficulties as well as the high costs involved in converting from analogue to digital. On March 2, 2013, 902 TV starts broadcasting again via Digea.
On 11 August 2013, the television station along with the relevant broadcast license was sold by the party to a private company called A-Horizon Media Ltd, and hence no longer has any afflication to the party. The station was renamed to Epsilon TV (E TV) and broadcasts completely different shows than 902 TV.
