30S is the smaller subunit of the 70S ribosome of prokaryotes. It is a complex of ribosomal RNA and ribonucleoproteins that functions in mRNA translation. It includes the 16S ribosomal RNA. It has about 21 basic proteins.
The 30S subunit is the site of inhibition for antibiotics such as tetracycline and aminoglycosides.



50S
Ribosomal RNA
50S is the larger subunit of the 70S ribosome of prokaryotes in the cell. It is the site of inhibition for antibiotics such as macrolides, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, and the pleuromutilins. It includes the 5S ribosomal RNA and 23S ribosomal RNA.
