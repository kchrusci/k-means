36 Ophiuchi is a triple star system 19.5 light years from Earth. It is in the constellation Ophiuchus.
The primary and secondary stars are nearly identical orange main sequence dwarves of spectral type K2/K1; the tertiary star is an orange main sequence dwarf of spectral type K5.
Star C is separated from the A-B pair by 700 arc seconds, compared to a minimum of 4.6 arcsec for A-B, so its effect on the movements of the A-B pair is small. A and B have active chromospheres.



Non-trigonometric distance estimates are marked in italic. The most precise estimate is marked in bold.



The McDonald Observatory team has set limits to the presence of one or more planets around 36 Ophiuchi A with masses between 0.13 and 5.4 Jupiter masses and average separations spanning between 0.05 and 5.2 astronomical units, although beyond 1.5 AU orbits are inherently unstable around either 36 Ophiuchi A or 36 Ophiuchi B.
